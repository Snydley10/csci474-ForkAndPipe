# csci474-Project1
The C++ code takes input data files that contain integers line-by-line. The user specifies the file index from (1, 2, 3). The program reads this file in and adds the numbers to a vector. Then it gets the number of child processes the user would like to create to run this program. The program then splits the data into evenly sized blocks and each child process adds the numbers up from their block and pipes the result to the parent. The parent prints each of the child results out and then prints the total result of all the numbers added up. The system time is also recorded to compare the speed of each file and process count configuration.*/
